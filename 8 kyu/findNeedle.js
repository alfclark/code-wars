/*

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example(Input --> Output)

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 
Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"

*/

function findNeedle(haystack) {
    let needle = haystack.findIndex((a)=> a == "needle")
    console.log('found the needle at position ' + needle)
    return 'found the needle at position ' + needle
  }
  
  findNeedle(['3', '123124234', undefined, 'needle', 'world', 'hay', 2, '3', true, false])
